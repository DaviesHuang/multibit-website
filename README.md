# Welcome to the MultiBit website

This wiki contains some information to help contributors to the [MultiBit website](https://multibit.org).

# Structure and layout

The website is a simple static HTML site that currently does not make use of page generators. Plans are in place to update the site to use a site generation tool such as Jekyll.

# How to contribute

Please fork the repository and make the changes that you would like, then issue a Pull request. The MultiBit team will review your changes and if they are useful and safe we will pull them in and give you credit for your contribution.
