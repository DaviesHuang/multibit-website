# Welcome to the MultiBit Website Repository

This repo contains the source for the main MultiBit website.

# Acknowledgements

Much of the groundwork for this website was put in place by Saivann Carigan - thanks from the MultiBit team!

# Requirements

The site is built using the Jekyll static website builder. To run it up locally for development and changes you'll need to install Ruby and a bunch of gems.

* jekyll
* aquarium
* json
* less
* therubyracer

The following Unix commands will get you up and running straight away:

    sudo apt-get install rubygems ruby1.9.1-dev build-essential
    sudo gem install jekyll aquarium json less therubyracer

If you're on other operating systems you may need to review the Ruby and gem installation instructions for your platform.

# Building

After the gems are in place you can build the current version of the site from the `master` branch using

    jekyll --server

then browse to `localhost:4000`. This will serve the content generated in `_site`.

# Making changes

If you make changes then you'll need to update some extra support files.

To bump the site version... update DOWNLOAD\_VERSION in _config.yml
If you've changed a page... run `./_contrib/updatesitemap` 

# Translation

Bitcoin is a global currency and so this site has many translations. If you'd like to contribute your own translation for the pages on offer please use this process:

1. Find the two letter ISO 639-1 code for your language (fr, en, jp)
1. Run `./_contrib/translate (language code) (language name)`
1. Make sure that languages are listed in alphabetical order in `_config.yml`
1. Rename html files in `(lang)/` according to your language. 
1. Update links in `_layouts/base-(lang).html` and `(lang)/*.html` to reflect your changes
1. Translate all `.html` and image files in `(lang)/` and `_layouts/base-(lang).html`

Tip: You can preview your work in a simple Google Chrome browser with no HTTP server. Just go to the existing English page, open the JavaScript console (`CTRL + SHIFT + J`) and use the following command to make the page editable : `document.body.contentEditable=true`

## Advanced Usage

The following are for administrators of the site and don't affect most people.

### Alerts

You can easily put a global alert on the website by changing the `ALERT` and `ALERT\_CLASS` variables in `_config.yml`.

You can also set an alert specific to a language by appending the language code to the `ALERT`.

Here is an example:

```
ALERT_CLASS: error
ALERT: <strong>Security alert:</strong> Please upgrade to 0.3.25 as soon as possible!
ALERT_fr: <strong>Alerte de sécurité:</strong> Mettez MultiBit à jour vers la version 0.3.25 sans délais!
```

The above will produce an English red alert box for all languages, and a translated red alert box for the French language. 

You may choose to change the alert colour, in which case possible classes are: error (red), info (blue), success (green) and warning (yellow)

### Release Notes

Release notes should be placed in `_posts/releases/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SHORTTITLE.md` and adhere to this format:

```
---
layout: post
title: MultiBit version 0.4.18 released
src: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/bitcoin-multibit/CKYhvXQtCSs
category: releases
---

MultiBit v0.4.18 is now available for download at
<https://multibit.org/releases/multibit-0.4.18/>

... and some release notes here ...

In general pages follow this format

```
* `SHORTTITLE` is used to construct the URL. Something like `v0.4.18` will be fine
* `layout: post` important for Jekyll
* `title: ...` will be used as the title
* `src: ...` (optional) link to full annoucement
* `category: ...` category of post
** `releases`
** `events`
