<h2>What is a private key ?</h2>
<p>Private keys are long strings of letters and numbers that are literally the key to spending your bitcoin. Each wallet has a number of private keys (one for each receiving address).</p>
<p>You always want to keep your private keys secret. Anyone who knows the private key for an address can spend all the bitcoin at that address.</p>
<p>You should treat your private keys as confidential material like you would the keys to the front door of your house.</p>
