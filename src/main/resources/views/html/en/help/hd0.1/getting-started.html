<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>MultiBit HD is designed to be as easy to use as possible. It is intended for domestic (or small scale merchant) users
  who wish to use a desktop computer for their day to day Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>This guide will provide you with the first steps you should take after you have installed MultiBit HD so that you can
  be confident about how to get things done safely.</p>

<h4>Installing with Install4j</h4>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html" target="_blank">Install4j</a> to create our installers
so that we can support the widest range of environments.</p>

<p>After downloading the installation program, simply double click the icon and follow the on-screen instructions. In most
cases simply accepting the defaults will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The installer ships with a Java virtual machine (JVM) that is compatible with MultiBit HD. As a result, when you first
run MultiBit after installation it will take a little longer to configure itself. Subsequent starts are much faster.</p>

<h4>Automatic updates</h4>
<p>When starting MultiBit HD will check to see if it is the latest version. If a more recent version is detected an upgrade
wizard will be shown so that you can download the latest code and benefit from enhanced features and bug fixes.</p>

<h4>The welcome wizard</h4>
<p>When you first open MultiBit HD you will see the welcome wizard. This will ask you to accept the terms and conditions and then to select
your preferred language.</p>




<h4>Step 4 - Send some bitcoin</h4>
<p>Spending bitcoin on goods and services helps to keep the Bitcoin economy growing. The first time you decide to send some bitcoin can be a little daunting so it is worth having a practice with a small amount beforehand.</p>
<p>The <a href="send-bitcoin.html" target="_blank">sending bitcoin</a> article explains how sending bitcoin to someone is done.</p>

<h4>Finish</h4>
<p>That's all there is to it. MultiBit will alert you if there is a newer version available and we recommend that you keep your version up to date as the developers are continuously improving it. If you encounter any problems, the <a href="/help.html">main help contents provide answers</a> to many common questions and you should
have a look there first.</p>
