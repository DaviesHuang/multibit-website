<h3>File descriptions</h3>
<p>When MultiBit HD runs, it creates various files on your computer. This help section describes what each of these files is for.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the files stored with your wallet:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>mbhd.wallet.aes&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main wallet file containing your private keys and transactions.</p></li>
  <li><p>mbhd.yaml&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains wallet configuration information.</p></li>
  <li><p>mbhd.checkpoints&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bitcoin checkpoints file, used in syncing your wallet.</p></li>
  <li><p>mbhd.spvchain&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bitcoin blockstore, used in syncing your wallet</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Contacts</b>. In the ‘contacts’ directory is stored a file ‘contacts.aes’. This contains your contacts information.</p>
<p><b>Payments</b>. In the ‘payments’ directory is stored a file ‘payments.aes’. This contains your payments information.</p>
<p><b>History</b>. In the ‘history’ directory is stored a file ‘history.aes’. This contains your history information.</p>
<p><b>Rolling backups</b>. In your rolling backup directory you will see files with the name ‘mbhd-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.wallet.aes’. These are rolling wallet backup files. Every time the wallet writes to disk, the existing wallet is kept as a backup. The main purpose of this file is to recover from any sudden loss of power that prevents a clean wallet save. The last four rolling backups are kept.</p>
<p><b>Local zip backups</b>. In the directory ‘zip-backup’ are stored encrypted zip copies of all the files in your wallet directory.</p>
<p><b>Cloud backups</b>. If you have a cloud backup directory set for your wallet, the local zip backups are regularly copied to your cloud backup directory.</p>
