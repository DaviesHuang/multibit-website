<h3>File descriptions</h3>

<p>This is a technical article aimed at people with working knowledge of navigating files on their computer.</p>

<p>When MultiBit HD runs, it creates various files on your computer. This help section describes what each of these files is for.</p>

<h4>Installation directory</h4>

<p>The installation directory is where you installed MultiBit HD. No configuration files or wallets are stored there normally.</p>

<p>If you chose the default installation options, you will find the MultiBit HD application in one of the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows (7,8) - <code>C:\Program Files\MultiBit HD</code></li>
  <li>OS X - <code>/Applications/MultiBit HD</code></li>
</ul>

<h4>Application directory</h4>

<p>The application directory is where MultiBit HD will store your configuration and wallets. This allows you to safely upgrade
  MultiBit HD without worrying about deleting important data.</p>

<p>In the following section <code>[EXAMPLE]</code> is used to indicate an environment variable called "EXAMPLE". Environment variables
  are used to provide common starting points for directories. If you have an unusual set up you may need to refer to these to locate
  where MultiBit HD has placed its application directory. Open a "command prompt" or "Terminal" and type "set" or "export" to see a
  list of them.</p>

<p>Before exploring environment variables, try one of the following locations.<strong>You may need to enable hidden directories</strong>.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>[APPDATA]/MultiBitHD</code>. Windows (7,8): <code>C:\Documents and Settings\example\AppData\Roaming\MultiBitHD</code>
  <li><code>[APPDATA]/MultiBitHD</code>. Windows (XP and below): <code>C:\Documents and Settings\example\Application Data\MultiBitHD</code>
</ul>

<h4>OS X</h4>
<p>In OS X the user Library directory is normally hidden. Follow the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/02/25/show-hidden-files-in-os-x/">show hidden files</a>
  instructions to reveal it in the Finder.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[user.home]/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD</code>. OS X 10.5+: <code>/Users/example/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD</code>
</ul>

<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>In Linux the user home directory is normally hidden due to the leading ".".</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[user.home]/.MultiBitHD</code>. Ubuntu/Debian: <code>/home/example/.MultiBitHD</code>
</ul>

<h4>Explanation of file and directories</h4>

<p>Here is a list of the files that MultiBit HD uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>mbhd.yaml</code> - Contains general preferences and configuration information (theme, exchange etc).</li>
  <li><code>mbhd.checkpoints</code> - A Bitcoin checkpoints file, used when syncing your wallet.</li>
  <li><code>mbhd.spvchain</code> - A Bitcoin block store, used when syncing your wallet</li>
</ul>

<p>All wallets are stored encrypted in directories organised as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>mbhd.wallet.aes</code> - This is the main wallet file containing your private keys and transactions.</li>
  <li><code>contacts.aes</code>. In the ‘contacts’ directory is stored a file ‘contacts.aes’. This contains your contacts information.</li>
  <li><code>payments.aes</code>. In the ‘payments’ directory is stored a file ‘payments.aes’. This contains your payments information.</li>
  <li><code>history.aes</code>. In the ‘history’ directory is stored a file ‘history.aes’. This contains your history information.</li>
  <li><code>rolling-backup</code>. In your rolling backup directory you will see files with the name ‘mbhd-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.wallet.aes’. These are rolling wallet backup files. Every
    time the wallet writes to disk, the existing wallet is kept as a backup. The main purpose of this file is to recover from any sudden loss of power that prevents a clean wallet
    save. The last four rolling backups are kept.
  </li>
  <li><code>zip-backup</code>. In the directory ‘zip-backup’ are stored encrypted zip copies of all the files in your wallet directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a cloud backup directory set for your wallet, the local zip backups are <a href="backups.html">regularly copied to your cloud backup directory</a>.</p>

<h4>I've accidentally deleted something!</h4>

<p>Don't worry. So long as you have your wallet words you can recover your bitcoins. See <a href="restore-wallet.html">"Restoring a wallet"</a>
  for step by step instructions to recover.</p>

<p>Deleting different files will have different impacts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>mbhd.yaml</code> - You'll need to work through the welcome wizard but you can select "Use an existing wallet" when prompted</li>
  <li><code>mbhd.checkpoints</code> - Synchronization will take a very long time, it is best to re-install MultiBit HD</li>
  <li><code>mbhd.spvchain</code> - Synchronization will take a long time based on how old your wallet is</li>
</ul>
