<h4>Using TOR</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">The Onion Router (TOR) protocol</a> is a way of defending your internet activity
against traffic analysis. TOR protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all
around the world. In this respect it is similar to the Bitcoin network except that TOR is for general purpose internet communication.</p>

<p>Due to the way that TOR works, connections through it can be slower than direct connections and as a result while your communications
are made much more private it - currently - comes at the cost of reduced speed. For this reason we have not enabled TOR by default. As the
number of TOR nodes in the network increases so does the traffic speed (again just like Bitcoin and full nodes).</p>
