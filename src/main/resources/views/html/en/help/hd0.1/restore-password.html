<h3>Restore password</h3>

<p>If you forget your wallet password, then you need to restore your password from seed.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your wallet words</h4>

<p><strong>To restore your wallet and recover your bitcoin, you must have your wallet words.</strong></p>
<p>With your wallet words, you can recover your password, and so recover your bitcoin.  You must keep your wallet words safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your seed
  phrase can restore your wallet, and steal your bitcoin.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - From the Unlock screen select "Restore" then select "I have forgotten my password"</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions on the MultiBit HD screen.</p>

<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten both your password and your wallet words then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin. There is <strong>absolutely
  no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted wallet files safe just in case inspiration strikes and you somehow remember the password.</p>
