<h3>Restore password</h3>

<p>If you forget your wallet password, then you can restore your password from your wallet words.</p>

<h4>I have my wallet words to hand</h4>

<p>You must keep your wallet words safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your wallet words can restore your wallet, and steal your bitcoin.</p>

<p>Avoid exposing your wallet words in a public place which may have high definition surveillance cameras present.</p>

<p>The procedure is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start MultiBit HD and click Restore from the Unlock screen</li>
  <li>Select "I have forgotten my password" and click Next</li>
  <li>Select the wallet type (e.g. MultiBit HD or Trezor) from the drop down list</li>
  <li>Enter your wallet words exactly as you wrote them down (order is important)</li>
  <li>Observe a "Verified" message when you have completed the list</li>
  <li>Click Next</li>
  <li>Observe a short delay while your password is extracted then displayed</li>
  <li>Click Finish to return to the Unlock screen</li>
</ol>

<h4>I've lost my wallet words is there anything I can do ?</h4>

<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten both your password and your wallet words then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin.</p>

<p>There is <strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted wallet files safe just in case inspiration strikes and you somehow remember the password or the location of your wallet words.</p>

<p>At this point your only hope is that you still have control of the wallet and all you need to do is find your password. There are several possibilities to explore:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you are using the most recent password you know</li>
  <li>Try combinations - change one character at a time to upper- or lowercase, swap characters, add a ! to the end and so on</li>
  <li>If the password uses non-English characters consider the effect of the local language mis-coding them</li>
  <li>Capitalisation works differently in non-English locales, such as Turkey.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a last resort go to a quiet room and relax. Think about where you might have put a copy of your wallet words or password. Perhaps one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden file somewhere?</li>
  <li>USB drive?</li>
  <li>Encrypted copy held on LastPass or KeePass? You should be using a secure password generator with 14 or more random characters.</li>
  <li>Accidental copy on a local backup service like Time Machine or rsync?</li>
  <li>An intentional encrypted copy on SpiderOak, Dropbox or GDrive?</li>
  <li>Maybe you wrote it down and put it in a book, or an old drawer?</li>
  <li>Does a trusted friend or relative have a copy?</li>
</ul>

<h4>I think they're in my password manager but there's hundreds to try...</h4>
<p>Some password managers provide a means to export their contents for backup purposes. From a security point of view this is a <strong>very risky</strong> thing to do
  but desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>Assuming that you know the risks of exposing all your passwords and you are an advanced user of the command shell, here is what you can do to quickly work through a list of
  password candidates:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Locate the key backup file the wallet directory (it has a .key extension) and copy it to a secure location on a safe machine (call it <code>target.key</code>).</li>
  <li>Use your password manager's export function to copy your password as a CSV (comma separated values) file to the same location as the key file (call it <code>passwords.csv</code>).</li>
  <li>Examine the CSV file to determine its layout (e.g. url,username,password,label etc) and note the column number of the password (it is 3 in the example).</li>
  <li>Copy this Unix script (it might need modification for Windows) alongside the CSV file (call it <code>apply-guesses.sh</code>) and give it executable permissions with <code>chmod +x apply-guesses.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo Usage: apply-guesses.sh [password CSV] [key file]
echo Password file: $1
echo Key file: $2
for password in $( awk -F , -v OFS=' ' '{print $3}' $1 ); do
   echo ------
   echo Attempting: $password...
   openssl enc -d -p -aes-256-cbc -a -in $2 -out recovered.key -pass pass:$password
   if [ $? -eq 0 ];
     then
       echo "Success!";
       break;
     else
       echo "Failed";
   fi
   echo ------
done
</pre>

<p>You may need to adjust the <code>{print $3}</code> section on line 5 to reflect the password column (e.g. <code>{print $12}</code> if password is in position 12).</p>

<p>Once ready execute the script as follows:</p>
<pre>
$ ./apply-guesses.sh passwords.csv target.key
</pre>

<p>The script will report each password as it tries it and will stop immediately upon successful decryption. If all goes well you can use the password with MultiBit HD to rescue
  your bitcoins.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you tidy up all your files after you have finished</strong>. Use the Unix "secure delete" command to remove each file in turn
  using the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm if available:</p>
<pre>
$ srm passwords.csv
$ srm target.key
$ srm recovered.key
</pre>

<p><strong>Make sure you erase your terminal scrollback history</strong> to avoid leaving traces of console output containing passwords. In MacOS Terminal use Edit | Clear
  Scrollback. On Linux <code>echo -e '\0033\0143'</code> might do the trick. Windows, um, no idea.</p>

<h3>Nope that didn't work...</h3>

<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten your password and wallet words and you only have encrypted wallets, then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin.
  There is <strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted files safe just in case inspiration strikes. Never delete a private key, just archive it safely.</p>
