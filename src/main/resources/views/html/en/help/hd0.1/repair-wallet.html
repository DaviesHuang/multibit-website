<p>Occasionally you get transactions that never seem to confirm. If you have a transaction that has not confirmed for
  several hours but you know it is definitely on the blockchain (because you visited Blockchain.info or Blockexplorer.com and checked
  the transaction ID) then you can reset your blockchain.</p>
<p>This process gives MultiBit the opportunity to revisit old transactions. During this process MultiBit will
  check if a transaction has fully confirmed. If so, then it will appear in your transaction list.</p>

<h4>How to reset the blockchain</h4>

  <li>Verify that your computer's clock is showing the correct time.</li>

    blockchain. When it is finished, your wallet should reflect what is on the blockchain.
  </li>
