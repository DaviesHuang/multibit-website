<h3>Restoring a wallet</h3>

<p>If your computer is lost, stolen or damaged, or perhaps you've accidentally deleted your MultiBit HD information, then you will
  need to restore a wallet. This article guides you through this process.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your wallet backups</h4>

<p>A wallet backup is an encrypted copy of your Bitcoin wallet that you can use to recover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your bitcoin</li>
  <li>your contacts and notes</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes</li>
  <li>the currencies and exchange rates used in payments</li>
</ul>

<p>If you followed the instructions in the <a href="getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide then you will have a cloud backup
  service that continuously uploads your encrypted wallet files to a server somewhere in the cloud.</p>

<p>If you don't have a cloud backup but you do have your seed phrase then you will be able to recover your bitcoin and any transactions
  present on the block chain. Unfortunately, all the extra information such as contact details, payment notes, exchange rates and so
  on are only present in wallet backups and will be lost.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - Start the restore process</h4>

<p>From the unlock screen click the "Restore" button and follow the instructions given in the restore wizard.</p>
