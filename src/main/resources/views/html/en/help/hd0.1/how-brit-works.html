<h3>FAQ for BRIT (our fee collection mechanism)</h3>

<p>We get a lot of queries about our fee collection mechanism so we have put together this FAQ to help you to see why we've done
  it. This article starts off fairly basic but goes into some detail about how BRIT works.</p>

<h4>I've heard that MultiBit HD isn't free. Is this true ?</h4>

<p>Yes. With MultiBit HD we are introducing a client fee of 1,000&nbsp;satoshi per spend. This compares favourably with the current
  miner's fee of 3,000&nbsp;satoshi.</p>

<p>At 500 USD per bitcoin this is 0.5 cents for each transaction sent. The <a
  href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324048904578319783080709860" target="_blank">price of a latte in a New York Starbucks</a>
  is about 4 USD which equates to 800 sends through MultiBit HD.</p>
<p>There is no charge for receiving bitcoin. We bundle up these small amounts so that you pay once every twenty to thirty sends from your wallet.</p>

<p>The revenue generated will go towards further development of MultiBit HD. We will also use the funds raised to support upstream projects
  that MultiBit HD relies upon (such as Bitcoinj, XChange etc) that would otherwise never see an income.</p>

<h4>But Bitcoin is free and open source...</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is not free in all cases. Typically transactions include a miner's fee to ensure that they get
  mined into a block quickly. The amount paid varies according to the data size of the transaction, the age of
  the bitcoin outputs involved and some other rules.</p>

<h4>Bitcoin doesn't work without the miners but wallets are commonplace</h4>
<p>That's true to some extent. There are many free and open source Bitcoin wallets available. However to make and distribute
  a high-quality Bitcoin wallet takes a lot of time and effort. For this to be sustainable in the long run the developers
  need to be paid.</p>


<p>MultiBit has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011. In that time it has seen continuous development and improvement.
  Back in March 2014 <a href="/blog/2014/03/10/multibit-downloads-reach-1.5m.html">we celebrated 1.5 million downloads</a> and we've been growing ever
  since.</p>
<p>Supporting a virtual metropolis of users and writing new features is now a full time job for a team of developers.</p>

<h4>What about funding it through adverts ?</h4>
<p>Too invasive. In general adverts provided by third parties place tracking cookies and monitor IP addresses. The advertisers themselves often want to
  have detailed demographic information. We believe very strongly in the privacy of our users so we do not want to expose them to this.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that technical users (including ourselves) tend to have ad-blocking software running and so don't see adverts presented in
  a browser context and we personally find in-app adverts to be both distracting and intrusive.</p>

<p>By charging a client fee we can avoid intrusive or privacy-breaking alternatives.</p>

<h4>What about paying upfront for it ?</h4>

<p>Possible but then we couldn't be pure Bitcoin. When people download a Bitcoin wallet for the first time they don't usually have any bitcoin to hand.
  Consequently we would have to ask for payment using a non-Bitcoin mechanism which would defeat the point of having Bitcoin in the first place.</p>

<p>There is also the problem of piracy. Once a signed, paid-for copy of MultiBit HD is out there it wouldn't be long before it is torrented. While we're
  happy for this to happen (we release under MIT licence after all) it would mean that ongoing income from sales would be limited.</p>

<p>Finally it is important to remember that people from all over the world use MultiBit HD and what is affordable to one group of people is very expensive
  to others. An upfront fee would restrict access to Bitcoin to only those who could afford it.</p>

<p>We want anyone, anywhere in the world to be able to download MultiBit HD without having to pay for it.</p>

<h4>So what are you proposing instead ?</h4>

<p>We're fortunate to be in this position to contribute to the Bitcoin community, and to enable us to keep paying the bills we designed a way to get income that matched these
  principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Must be open source under MIT license</li>
  <li>Fees must be extremely low</li>
  <li>No gathering or selling of information to third parties</li>
  <li>No in-app advertising</li>
  <li>Zero upfront cost</li>
  <li>Must be decentralised apart from an anonymous initial contact</li>
  <li>Must allow income to be allocated to other parties efficiently</li>
  <li>All communications must rely on encrypted messages to prevent snooping, MITM and replay attacks</li>
</ul>

To be continued

<h4>Can I inspect the code ?</h4>

<p>Yes. All the payment code, both client and server side, has been released under the MIT licence for other teams to use freely. The <a
  href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/brit-service" target="_blank">BRIT Service code and documentation</a> is available for examination
  on GitHub. The client code is currently within the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd" target="_blank">MultiBit HD repo</a>.</p>
