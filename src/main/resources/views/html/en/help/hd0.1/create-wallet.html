<h3>Create Wallet</h3>

<p>When you start MultiBit HD for the first time you will be shown the Welcome Wizard which will guide you through the
  process of creating a new wallet. If you want to create an additional wallet you can use the "Restore" button from
  the "Enter password" screen which will bring up the Welcome Wizard starting at the "Select Create Wallet Option" screen.</p>

<p>This help article will guide you through the Welcome Wizard from the beginning.</p>

<p>At this point you can choose to switch to a pre-existing wallet or restore one from a seed phrase. In this article
