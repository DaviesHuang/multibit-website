<h3>Wallet backups</h3>

<p><strong>You can always recover your bitcoin <a href="restore-wallet.html">through your wallet words (seed phrase).</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>So long as you know your wallet words</strong> (or your Trezor and PIN if you are using one) you can use a wallet backup to <a href="restore-wallet.html">recover</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your bitcoin</li>
  <li>your contacts and notes</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware and software can fail, be lost or stolen. MultiBit HD ensures that an automatic encrypted backup is made of your wallet
  to a location that you specify.</p>

<h4>Use a cloud backup service</h4>

<p>Setting up a cloud backup service is straightforward and for small amounts of data (under 2GB) it is often free. We would strongly
  urge you to consider SpiderOak for its end to end encryption. An alternative is Dropbox which is extremely common and provides an excellent user experience.</p>
<p>MultiBit HD encrypts all your cloud backup information using a strong AES key derived from either your wallet words or from a password provided by your Trezor. It is safe to store in the cloud without worrying about bad people being able to read your data.</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>MultiBit HD maintains three stages of wallet backup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rolling backup - these are recent copies of your wallet. They are encrypted with your wallet password / Trezor provided password</li>
  <li>local backup - this is a zip of the wallet directory (less blockchain) encrypted with a key derived from the wallet words or from your Trezor provided password. It is stored locally on your machine</li>
  <li>cloud backup - this is a zip of the wallet directory (less blockchain) encrypted with a key derived from the wallet words or from your Trezor provided password. It is copied to your cloud backup directory</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on the scheduling of these backups is given later.</p>

<h4>Encrypting "soft" wallets and their backups</h4>

<p>A "soft" wallet is one that is not linked to an external hardware device such as a <a href="https://buytrezor.com?a=4fbc03c60545" target="_blank">Trezor</a>.</p>

<p>The rolling backups encrypt a snapshot of the current wallet. Rolling backups are loaded automatically if the load of the primary wallet fails. The user is told if a rolling backup is loaded on the 'Wallet startup screen'.</p>

<p>When making a local or cloud backup we zip up the wallet directory and include the wallet password in encrypted form in the archive. Short wallet passwords are padded. The zip file is then encrypted using a key derived from
  the wallet words. This approach allows the password to be recovered from a cloud backup so long as the user knows the wallet words.</p>

<p>It also means that cloud backups are safe for long term off-site storage.</p>

<h4>Encrypting "hard" wallets and their backups</h4>

<p>A "hard" wallet is one that is linked to an external hardware device such as a Trezor. They provide much greater protection for your bitcoins because the
  private keys are never present on your desktop machine and are not susceptible to malware or viruses.</p>

<p>After entering the Trezor PIN number the password for your Trezor wallet is provided by the Trezor encrypting a fixed phrase in a deterministic manner. This password is also used to encrypt your cloud backups.</p>

<p>Therefore the only way to unlock either the wallet or the backups is to physically have the correct Trezor present and to know its PIN.</p>

<h4>Managing all the backups</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD maintains a comprehensive backup strategy consisting of rolling, local and cloud backups. While technical in nature
  interested readers may find the following information helpful.</p>

<p>After successfully unlocking a wallet MultiBit HD will follow this process to maintain backups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wait 1 minute after MultiBit HD starts and then start "ticking" every 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Every "tick" (2 minutes), create a rolling wallet backup. This is a copy of the encrypted wallet stored in the
    wallet's <code>rolling-backup</code> sub-directory. It is timestamped and encrypted with the wallet password.
    There are up to 4 of these in place covering the last 8 minutes of activity.
  </li>
  <li>Every "tick modulo 5" (10 minutes), create a zip backup in the wallet <code>zip-backup</code> directory. These
    are the local zip backups. This is everything in the wallet directory except the blockstore (always retrievable from
    the Bitcoin network) and the zip-backups themselves. Note that the rolling backups are put in the zip backup.
    It is a zip file which is then AES encrypted using a strong key derived from your wallet words or from a password provided by your Trezor.
  </li>
  <li>Every "tick modulo 15" (30 minutes), copy the just created zip backup to the cloud backup directory if one has
    been set.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling backups are made at 1, 3, 5, 7 ... minutes after start up</li>
  <li>Local zip backups at 1, 11, 21, 31, 41 ... minutes after start up</li>
  <li>Cloud zip backups at 1, 31, 61, 91 ... minutes after start up</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid excessive unnecessary data storage the rolling backups are pruned, oldest first, when there are more than 4
  backups using a secure delete mechanism.</p>

<p>The local and cloud zip backups are pruned when there are more than 60 using the following process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first 2 are always kept</li>
  <li>The last 8 are always kept</li>
  <li>For the remaining, the backup that was most rapidly replaced is secure deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach gradually spaces out the backups so that there is protection for the most recent changes and also the
  ability to go all the way back to the beginning if necessary.</p>
