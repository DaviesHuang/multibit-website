<h2 class="text-center">Thank you for choosing MultiBit HD</h2>

<p>Please take a look at our <a href="getting-started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> so you can be up and running with Bitcoin quickly and safely.</p>

<h3>How to install on Windows</h3>

<p>Double click the installer - it is signed by one of the MultiBit HD developers in the name of “James Burton”. Work through the installer - accepting the defaults is normally the
  easiest.</p>
<p>Currently the setting up of shortcuts is not complete so to get MultiBit HD to run go to the installation directory and double click the multibit-hd.exe. You can then pin the
  application to your taskbar.</p>
<p>If you have a firewall set up when you first open MultiBit HD you will be asked by Windows if you want MultiBit HD to communicate over your internet connection. MultiBit HD
  needs to communicate with the Bitcoin network and the multibit.org server so permit this access.</p>
