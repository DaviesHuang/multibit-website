<h3>How to install on Windows</h3>

<p><strong>Please note that for security reasons we do not support Windows XP and below.</strong></p>

<h4>64-bit Windows</h4>

<p>This is the default installer and is suitable for Windows Vista and higher.</p>

<p>Double click the installer - it is signed by one of the MultiBit HD developers in the name of “James Burton”. Work through the installer - accepting the defaults is normally the
  easiest.</p>
<p>Currently the setting up of shortcuts is not complete so to get MultiBit HD to run go to the installation directory and double click the multibit-hd.exe. You can then pin the
  application to your task bar.</p>
<p>If you have a firewall set up when you first open MultiBit HD you will be asked by Windows if you want MultiBit HD to communicate over your internet connection. MultiBit HD
  needs to communicate with the Bitcoin network and the multibit.org server so permit this access.</p>

<h4>32-bit Windows</h4>

<p>We maintain a <a href="https://multibit.org/releases/multibit-hd/multibit-hd-downloadVersion/multibit-hd-windows-downloadVersion.exe">32-bit Windows installer</a> for maximum
  backwards compatibility with Windows Vista on 32-bit architectures.</p>

<p>The installation process is the same as for the 64-bit version.</p>

<h4>Windows XP ?</h4>

<p>No. It has <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2013/08/15/the-risk-of-running-windows-xp-after-support-ends-april-2014/" target="_blank">too many security issues to be viable
  for Bitcoin software</a> outside of a highly controlled environment.</p>
