<h2>Upgrading MultiBit</h2>
<p>Every so often a new version of MultiBit will be released containing bug fixes and new features.</p>
<p>This guide will provide you with the correct process to follow when you decide to upgrade to a newer version. It is assumed that you have
  reviewed the <a href="help_gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guide and know where all your wallet files are.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Locate your wallet files</h3>
<p>If you have a standard installation upgrading MultiBit should be a seamless process. Your wallet and configuration files will not be in the
  same directory as the MultiBit application and will be in a location that is regularly backed up.</p>
<p>In a <strong>non-standard installation</strong> your wallet and configuration files will be in the <strong>same directory as the MultiBit application</strong>. This would likely
  cause the new version of MultiBit to ignore the previous wallets and configuration because it is not aware of them.</p>
<p>To avoid this situation, MultiBit recommends that you make sure that your wallets and configuration files are always kept separate from the
  installation directory.</p>
<p>You can always see the file location of your current wallet in the main title bar of your MultiBit window. For instance, it might say: "MultiBit - My wallet - /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit/multibit.wallet". The file name at the end is where your wallet is stored.</p>
<p>Applications are usually stored in <code>C:\Program Files</code> on Windows or <code>/Applications</code> on Mac.</p>

<h3>Step 2 (optional) - Move your wallets</h3>
<p>If you have a non-standard installation and want to move the wallets out of the MultiBit installation directory then please review the <a href="help_movingAWallet.html" target="_blank">Moving A Wallet</a> article.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Run the installer</h3>
<p>Download the installer from the <a href="https://multibit.org" target="_blank">official MultiBit site</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/how-to-check-signatures.html" target="_blank">verify the GPG signature</a> to be absolutely sure you have a legitimate copy.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="help_installing.html" target="_blank">standard installation instructions</a> for your computer.</p>

<h3>Finish</h3>
<p>That's all there is to it. MultiBit will alert you if there is a problem and the <a href="/help.html">main help contents provide answers</a> to many common questions.</p>
