<h2>Where MultiBit stores your data</h2>
<p>MultiBit stores user specific data such as logs and the default multibit.wallet in a 'user data
  directory'. This directory can be worked out as follows:</p>

<p>1) In any recent version of MultiBit, immediately after starting MultiBit the 'user data directory' is written at the very top of the 'Messages' tab. It will say something like:</p>
<ul><li><p>The user data directory is "/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit".</p></li></ul>
<p>2) Otherwise see if there is a multibit.properties in MultiBit's current working directory. If there is, use this directory as
  the user data directory. This is for backwards compatibility and for running everything from a USB drive.</p>
<p>3) Otherwise work out the user data directory as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>PC</p>
    <p><code>
      <"APPDATA" environment setting>/MultiBit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g.
    </code></p><p><code>
      (Recent Windows) C:/Documents and Settings/jim/AppData/Roaming/MultiBit
    </code></p><p><code>
      or 
    </code></p><p><code>
      (old Windows) C:/Documents and Settings/jim/Application Data/MultiBit
    </code></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Mac</p>
    <p><code>
      <"user.home" system property>/Library/Application Support/MultiBit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g.
    </code></p><p><code>
      /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit
    </code></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Linux</p>
    <p><code>
      <"user.home" system property>/MultiBit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. /Users/jim/MultiBit
    </code></p>
</ul>
<br/>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>You can often diagnose a problem with MultiBit by looking at the Messages window by selecting the 'View | <img width="16" height="16" title="Messages" alt="Messages" src="/images/en/v0_5/comment.png"/>&nbsp;Messages'
menu option.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description of what has happened with MultiBit there is a log file to look at. This is stored in
  the 'log' directory in your user data directory and is called 'multibit.log'.</p>
