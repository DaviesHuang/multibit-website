<h2>Balance is incorrect</h2>
<p>Sometimes when sending bitcoin the transaction fails to be relayed causing an incorrect balance to be shown. The relay failure usually appears
  when the "seen by 1 peer" message never increases. Normally peers relay quickly so if no peers have acknowledged in more than a minute then there
  is very likely to be a problem with the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>It is extremely unlikely that you have lost your bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<p>If the peers are relaying and the balance is still not correct then you should <a href="help_availableToSpend.html">review the "Spendable" article</a>.
  You may just need to wait for a few minutes for a confirmation to take place.</p>

<h3>It's not relaying - what should I do ?</h3>
<p>Since the problem is most likely caused by an earlier transaction (which could be any transaction you have ever received) it is necessary to perform a full
  reset of the blockchain going right back to <strong>the day before your very first transaction</strong>.</p>

  <li>Open MultiBit and make sure the wallet you are interested in is selected in the '<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                            title="Wallets"
                                                                                            alt="Wallets"
                                                                                            src="/images/en/v0_4/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets'
    side panel.
  </li>
  <li>Use the transactions tab and identify the date of the earliest transaction you ever made in MultiBit then <strong>take off an extra day</strong>.</li>

  <li>Go the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="/images/en/v0_4/resetTransactions.png"/>&nbsp;Reset
    Blockchain and Transactions' menu option.
  </li>
  <li>Select the "Specific reset date" option and enter the date from the previous step.</li>
  <li>MultiBit will start reloading the blockchain. This can take some time. Just let it run and download the
    blockchain. When it is finished, your wallet should reflect what is on the blockchain.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Even that didn't fix it - now what ?</h3>
<p>As a last resort you can attempt to "sweep the balance". This involves exporting your private keys into another wallet application
  and then using that application to send the entire balance back to MultiBit using a fresh wallet.</p>
