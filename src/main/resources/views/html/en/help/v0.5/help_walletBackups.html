<h2>Wallet backups</h2>
<p>A wallet backup is a copy of your Bitcoin wallet (or your wallet's <a href="help_whatIsAPrivateKey.html">private keys</a>) that you can use to recover your bitcoin if something bad happens to your original wallet file.</p>
<p>'Something bad' can mean anything from someone stealing your computer, a hard disk failure or some other serious computer problem.</p>
<p>MultiBit makes various copies of your wallet on your disk as it works. These are described in detail in <a href="help_fileDescriptions.html">File descriptions</a>. These can often be used to recover your wallet automatically when a problem occurs. Unfortunately if your computer is lost or stolen these backups are useless to you.</p>
<p>A good backup is a copy of your wallet file that you store on a USB drive. If you have a wallet containing substantial amounts of bitcoin make AT LEAST TWO copies of your wallet file on separate USB drives. Store them in different locations.</p>
<p>With MultiBit, when you create new receiving addresses in the 'Request' tab you need to make new backups.</p>
