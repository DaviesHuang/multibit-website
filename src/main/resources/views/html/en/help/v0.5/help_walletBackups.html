<h2>Wallet backups</h2>
<p>Wallet backups are an essential part of using bitcoin. A wallet backup is a copy of your Bitcoin wallet (or your wallet's private keys) that you can use to recover your bitcoin if something bad happens to your original wallet file.</p>
<p>'Something bad' can mean anything from someone stealing your computer, a hard disk failure or some other serious computer problem.</p>
<p>MultiBit makes various copies of your wallet on your disk as it works. These are described in detail in <a href="help_fileDescriptions.html">File descriptions</a>. These will often recover your wallet automatically when a problem occurs. Unfortunately this offers no protection if your computer is lost or stolen.</p>
<p>The best backups are stored on a device separate to your computer. USB drives stored in a safe place make for very good backups. If you have a wallet containing substantial amounts of bitcoin make AT LEAST TWO copies of your wallet file on separate USB drives. Store them in separate locations.</p>
<p>With MultiBit, when you create new receiving addresses in the 'Request' tab you need to make new backups.</p>
