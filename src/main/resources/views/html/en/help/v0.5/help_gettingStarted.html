<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>When you first open a new installation of MultiBit a new, empty wallet is created for you in your user data directory called 'multibit.wallet'.</p>
<p>When you first open MultiBit it will begin downloading data from the Bitcoin network.   It downloads a part of the 'block chain' that contains all the bitcoin transactions.</p>  
<br/>
<p>If you are a new user of Bitcoin, there are a couple of safety features that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>If you have substantial funds in a wallet: <b>Password protect your wallet.</b></p></li>
    <li><p>In case you lose your computer: <b>Backup your wallet.</b></p></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>There are more details on how to do these here:</p>
