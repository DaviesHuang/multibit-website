<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>When you first open MultiBit a new, empty wallet is created for you called 'multibit.wallet'.</p>
<p>MultiBit also starts downloading the data it needs from the Bitcoin network. This normally takes a minute or so.</p>  
<br/>
<p>If you are a new user of Bitcoin, there are a couple of safety features that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>If you have substantial funds in a wallet:  <a href="help_walletTypes.html"><b>Password protect your wallet.</b></a></p></li>
    <li><p>In case you lose your computer: <a href="help_walletBackups.html"><b>Backup your wallet.</b></a></p></li>
</ul>
