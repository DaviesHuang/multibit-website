<h2>Could not decrypt bytes</h2>
<p>You see this message if you enter an incorrect password when working with an encrypted wallet. It can appear in any of the operations that require a password e.g. send bitcoin.</p>
<p>Check carefully the password you are entering matches EXACTLY the password you have set on your wallet.</p>
<p>Note that the only record of your password is with you. MultiBit.org does not have a record of your password.</p>
