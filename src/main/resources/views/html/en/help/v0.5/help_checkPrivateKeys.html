<h2>Check private keys</h2>
<p>You can use this option to cross check your wallet's private keys to the wallet's receiving addresses. This checks the internal consistency of your wallet.</p>
<p>To check the private keys of a wallet, do the following:</p>

  <li><p>To check the private keys for the wallet specified, click on the button '<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                       title="Check private keys"
                                                                                       alt="Check private keys"
                                                                                       src="/images/en/v0_5/checkKey.png"/>&nbsp;Check
    private keys'. When the check of the private keys is complete a message appears.</p></li>
<ol>
  <li><p>If the check was successful your wallet is internally consistent and there is nothing more for you to do.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the check was unsuccessful a note appears telling you to read the Messages tab. In the Messages tab are details of which addresses do not have the correct private keys. You should NOT send any bitcoin to these addresses as it will not be redeemable.</p><p>Any existing balance on the addresses specified can only be redeemed by recovering the private keys. You should search your MultiBit and blockchain.info backup wallets and private key exports to find these private keys. You can then import them into your wallet of choice and recover your bitcoin. If you have NO copy of the relevant private keys in ANY backup then the bitcoin on these addresses will not be redeemable.</p></li>
