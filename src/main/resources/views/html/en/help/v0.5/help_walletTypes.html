<h2>What are the different types of wallets ?</h2>
<p>There are two types of wallets in MultiBit. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non password protected wallets. They are shown with the icon '<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                         title="Non password protected wallet"
                                                                         alt="Non password protected wallet"
                                                                         src="/images/en/v0_5/singleWallet.png"/>'.
  </li>
  <li>Password protected wallets. Their icon is '<img width="16" height="16" title="Password protected wallet"
                                                      alt="Password protected wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/lock.png"/>'.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Password protected wallets are much more secure than non password protected ones. It is recommended that you password
  protect all MultiBit wallets that contain more than a little 'loose change'. You can add a password to a wallet using
  the 'File | <img width="16" height="16" title="Add Password" alt="Add Password" src="/images/en/v0_5/lockAdd.png"/> Add Password'
  menu option.</p>
<p>You need to use a strong password.</p>
<p>Do not lose the password that you use for a wallet. You need your password to spend your bitcoin. There is no way to
  recover your password if you lose it.</p>
