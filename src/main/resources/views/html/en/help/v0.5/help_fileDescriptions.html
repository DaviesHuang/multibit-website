<h2>File descriptions</h2>
<p>When MultiBit runs, it creates various files on your computer. This help section describes what each of these files is for. For the purpose of illustration, imagine you have created a new wallet called <b>saving.wallet</b>. Here is a list of what files you will see in your user data area:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>saving.wallet&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main wallet file containing your private keys and transactions.</p></li>
  <li><p>saving.info&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains the description of the wallet and the labels you have given to your addresses.</p></li>
  <li><p>saving-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.wallet&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is a timestamp. This is the rolling wallet backup file. Every time the wallet writes to disk, the existing wallet is kept as a backup. Only one backup is kept. The main purpose of this file is to recover from any sudden loss of power that prevents a clean wallet save.</p></li>
  <li><p>saving-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.key&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have several of these. With an encrypted wallet every time you add or change the password, add a receiving address or import private keys an encrypted, timestamped export of your private keys is created. This is encrypted with your wallet password. You can use these to recover the essentials of your wallet by importing one of these files into a new wallet.</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>There are also non wallet related files that are created in MultiBit. These are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>multibit.properties&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the MultiBit configuration file.</p></li>
  <li><p>multibit.blockchain&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the MultiBit blockchain, an early format.</p></li>
  <li><p>multibit.spvstore&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the MultiBit blockchain, a more advanced format.</p></li>
  <li><p>multibit.checkpoints&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the MultiBit checkpoints file. This is used to avoid having to download the whole blockchain.</p></li>
</ul>
