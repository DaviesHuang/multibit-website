<h2>Wallet management</h2>
<p>With MultiBit, you can have as many wallets as you like.   They are usually given the file extension ".wallet".</p>
<p>When you open MultiBit, the wallets that were open in the previous use of MultiBit are reopened.   If this is the first time you have opened MultiBit a new, empty wallet file called 'multibit.wallet' is created in your user data directory. </p>
<p>Your wallets appear in the side panel labelled '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="/images/en/v0_5/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets'.  Click on one of the wallets to make it the active wallet. The balance for the active wallet is shown in the top left of the MultiBit screen. The wallet description and file location are shown in the title of the MultiBit window.</p>
<p><b>Create a new wallet</b></p>
<p>To create a new wallet, click on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="New Wallet" alt="New Wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/createNew.png"/>&nbsp;New Wallet' button or choose the menu option 'File | <img width="16" height="16" title="New Wallet" alt="New Wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/createNew.png"/>&nbsp;New Wallet'.   This opens a dialog window where you choose the location and name of the new wallet.   Click 'Ok' and a new wallet is created with the default description 'Your wallet description'.   You can change this to something more descriptive by clicking on the text.</p>
<p><b>Open a wallet</b></p>
<p>To open another wallet, choose the 'File | <img width="16" height="16" title="Open Wallet" alt="Open Wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/openWallet.png"/>&nbsp;Open Wallet' menu option.   This opens a file chooser dialog where you can choose the wallet to open. When the wallet is opened MultiBit automatically synchronises it to get the latest transactions.</p><p>Note that MultiBit cannot open the wallet files from the Satoshi bitcoin client (wallet.dat files).</p> 

<p><b>Close a wallet</b></p>
<p>To close a wallet, choose the 'File | <img width="16" height="16" title="Close Wallet" alt="Close Wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/closeWallet.png"/>&nbsp;Close Wallet' option.  This saves and closes the wallet and it is no longer shown in MultiBit. It is still stored on your disk - it is not deleted.</p>

<p><b>Delete a wallet</b></p>
<p>There is a hidden menu option to delete a wallet. It is not shown by default to avoid accidental loss of wallets and is intended for more experienced users. See the file 'configuration.txt' in your installation directory for more details.</p>
