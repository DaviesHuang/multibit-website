<h2>Lost or forgotten password</h2>
<h2>What is the symptom ?</h2>
<p>You're certain you typed in your password correctly, but MultiBit is not unlocking your wallet.</p>
<h2>What can you do about it ?</h2>
<p>MultiBit does not change passwords to encrypted wallets without your knowledge. There are several possibilities to explore:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you are using the most recent password you know. </li>
  <li>Try combinations - change one character at a time to upper- or lowercase, swap characters.</li>
  <li>Examine the rolling wallet backups, and apply the same process.</li>
  <li>Examine the automatic private key exports - these are encrypted with your wallet password when they are generated</li>
</ol>

<p>As a last resort go to a quiet room and relax. Think about where you might have put a copy of the password. Perhaps one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden file somewhere?</li>
  <li>USB drive?</li>
  <li>Encrypted copy held on LastPass or KeyPass? You should be using a secure password generator with 14 or more random characters.</li>
  <li>Accidental copy on a local backup service like Time Machine or rsync?</li>
  <li>An intentional encrypted copy on Dropbox or GDrive?</li>
  <li>Maybe you wrote it down and put it in a book, or an old drawer?</li>
  <li>Does a trusted friend or relative have a copy?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten your password and you only have encrypted wallets, then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin. There is
<strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>
