<h2>Could not understand address in import file</h2>
<p>You see this message if you try to import private keys in a format that Multibit doesn't recognise.<p>  
<p>You can fix this problem by putting the keys you want to import into the same format that Multibit uses to export keys - see <a href='help_exportingPrivateKeys.html#exportFileFormat'>Export file format</a>.</p>
