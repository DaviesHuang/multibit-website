<h3>Payment protocol support (BIP 70)</h3>

<p>BIP 70 is a Bitcoin standard describing how merchants and wallet developers can work together to produce a seamless buying experience. It is supported by MultiBit HD Beta 8.</p>
<p>This blog article gives a walk through of how it all works, using a donation to multibit.org as an example payment.</p>
<h4>User clicks on a 'Bitcoin payment request' link</h4>
<p>A Bitcoin payment request is a small file that the user downloads with a browser click, or gets sent via email. If the user clicks on such a file MultiBit HD starts up and, after wallet start up, shows the user an alert:</p>

</p>

<h4>User reviews Bitcoin payment request</h4>
<p>The user reviews the Bitcoin payment request as shown below. They can pay it immediately by clicking the 'Pay this payment request' or dismiss it for the moment by
  clicking on the 'Finish' button.
</p>
<p>Note that this test payment request was not signed by our multibit.org SSL certificate and hence is untrusted. Merchants will typically sign
    their payment requests with the same SSL certificates they use for their websites.</p>

<h4>User pays payment request</h4>
<p>Paying a payment request is very similar to paying a regular bitcoin payment. The user authorises the request with their password:</p>

</p>

<p>and then they see a 'Send progress' screen like this:</p>

</p>

<h4>User sends merchant a note and receives a receipt</h4>
<p>With BIP 70 the user can send a note directly to the merchant - perhaps they want their order in a particular color ? -  and they also receive a receipt. This is shown in the next two screenshots:</p>

</p>

<p>
  <img src="/images/en/blog/payment-protocol/receipt-note.png"
       title="Receipt note" height="664" width="1094">
</p>

<p>Note in real life the receipt note would be a bit more interesting - we are simply echoing back what the user sent us.</p>
<p>This blog describes a basic BIP70 workflow, but there is a lot more - refund addresses, specifying multiple payment addresses to implement merge avoidance and we expect this functionality to develop over time as more merchants and wallet developers roll out its use</p>
