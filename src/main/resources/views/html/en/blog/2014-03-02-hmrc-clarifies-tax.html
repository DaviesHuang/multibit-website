<h1>HMRC clarifies tax on UK Bitcoin businesses</h1>

<p>Normally we at MultiBit keep a low profile, but once in a while we like to let people know what we've been doing behind the scenes. Today is one of those days.</p>

<p>On 2nd March 2014, news broke via the Financial Times in the UK (see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zcwho/britain_to_scrap_bitcoin_tax/" target="_blank">the article on Reddit</a>)
  that HMRC (the UK equivalent of the US Inland Revenue Service) had been in talks with various members of the UK Bitcoin community to clear up the tax treatment of Bitcoin. Prior to this UK entrepreneurs
  were struggling to get their businesses off the ground in the face of the crippling tax burden being imposed - mostly due to 20% VAT (sales tax) on the use of Bitcoin. Also the lack of
clear guidance about Bitcoin from HMRC was making it difficult for banks to accept Bitcoin businesses thus slowing down adoption.</p>

<p>Clearly something had to be done, and fortunately the UK Bitcoin community began discussions with HMRC to provide them with better information about what Bitcoin
  was and how it should be treated under UK tax law. HMRC, to its credit, listened and came back with a much improved set of tax rules for Bitcoin in the UK.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/news/index.htm" target="_blank">full details can be found on their website</a> but the short version is that UK businesses
can now (and retroactively) treat Bitcoin just as they would for any other foreign currency. All taxes are to be paid in Sterling as normal, but accounts maintained in
  Bitcoin would be treated the same as if they were maintained in, say, US dollars or Euros.</p>

<p>Gary Rowe, CEO of <a href="http://bitcoin-solutions.co.uk" target="_blank">Bitcoin Solutions</a> the UK limited company behind MultiBit, attended the final meeting to help review
  the final draft of the proposal. In the run up he, along with others, provided HMRC with additional information about Bitcoin and its importance to the UK economy. He commented
  that, <i>"HMRC started out not knowing much about Bitcoin but very quickly applied themselves and have come up with a tax treatment that is both fair and reasonable
  to UK Bitcoin businesses. I hope that this will show people that the UK is Bitcoin-friendly."</i></p>

<p>All in all, this is a big step forward for Bitcoin in the UK.</p>
