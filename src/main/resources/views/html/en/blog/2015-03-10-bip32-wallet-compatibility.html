<h3>BIP32 Wallet compatibility</h3>

<p>Thanks to the sterling work of github user 'gurnec', beta testing has discovered that our hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets are unfortunately not BIP 32 compliant.
  The importance of 'BIP 32 compliance' to the regular Bitcoin user is that they can restore their MultiBit HD wallet words in any other BIP 32 compliant Bitcoin wallet.
  The current MultiBit HD wallets are perfectly good HD wallets but unfortunately we made a mistake in the address generation code. This is fixed in release 0.0.8beta. This is the github issue describing the technical details : <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd/issues/445">#445</a></p>

<p>When using MultiBit HD 0.0.8beta (or later) any new wallet and a regular restore from your wallet words will produce a BIP 32 compliant wallet. This means you will be generating the same addresses as other BIP 32 wallets such as Lighthouse.</p>
<p>Any existing wallets will continue to work without change but restoring from your wallet words for older wallets is a little more complex (see section below)</p>
<p>Trezor wallets are not effected.</p>
<p>Thanks to github user 'gurnec' for detecting this incompatibility thus enabling us to fix it early in our beta program.</p>

<h4>How to restore a 'MultiBit HD Beta7' wallet</h4>

<p>The vast majority of MultiBit HD users will never see a wallet generated by version 0.0.7beta or earlier. (We call these wallets 'Beta7' wallets).
To restore a Beta7 wallet from your wallet words you need to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go into "Tools | Labs" and enable the option "Enable restore of Beta7 wallets".</li>
  <li>From the password entry screen, press the 'Restore' button and then select the 'Restore wallet' option. Press next.</li>
  <li>On the first screen where you enter your wallet words, make sure the reply to "What created these wallet words ?" is "MultiBit HD (Beta7 - Not BIP 32 compliant)".</li>
  <li>Continue through the 'Restore wallet' wizard as normal.</li>
</ol>

<p>By enabling and selecting this normally hidden option you tell MultiBit HD to use the old, non-BIP 32 compliant wallet format in order to recover your bitcoins.</p>
