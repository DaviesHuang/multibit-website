<h3>Bitcoin network stress test</h3>

<p>On 20 June 2015 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3agk61/ultimate_bitcoin_stress_test_monday_june_22nd/" target="_blank">CoinWallet.eu announced</a>
  that they would perform a Bitcoin network stress test starting Monday 22 June 2015 and extending over 100 blocks (approximately 32 hours). The intention was to discover
  in advance whether the block size limit of 1Mb would, when transaction volume exceeded its capacity, allow for quick recovery of the network to normal service.</p>

<p>During the stress test a range of fees, some exceeding 1,000 satoshis, was allocated to each transaction. In simple terms, any Bitcoin wallet providing a fee
  less than or equal to this value would produce transactions that would be in competition with the stress test transactions and therefore potentially subject to a delay.</p>

<p>The fee associated with a transaction is largely dependent on the size in bytes of the transaction. The base fee is attached
  to the smallest transaction, and for each 1,000 bytes of additional size another 1,000 satoshis is added. Miners will generally
  pick transactions with higher fees from the backlog and bring them to the front of the queue.</p>

<p>A more complex view would include the age of the coins and the "fee rate" applied. Bitcoin rules prioritise older coins over newer ones and miners are suspected of
  prioritising transactions where the size in bytes of the transaction has a disproportionately larger fee thus increasing the "fee rate".</p>

<p>We monitored the behaviour of both MultiBit HD (0.1.0) and Classic (0.5.18) during the stress test and the results are given
  below.</p>

<h4>MultiBit HD</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD uses a default base fee of 3,000 satoshis which can be adjusted up or down through a range of 1,000 to 10,000 using
  the Preferences | Fees panel. Our research during development of MultiBit HD indicated that 3,000 satoshis would usually place
  the transaction into the next block.</p>

<p>During the early part of the stress test we found the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (1,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (3,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (10,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>all transactions OK after Repair Wallet:</li>
</ul>

<h4>MultiBit Classic</h4>

<p>MultiBit Classic uses a fixed base fee of 1,000 satoshis. It cannot be varied so users are not able to respond to an emerging
  "fee market". We strongly urge users of MultiBit Classic to <a href="/help/hd0.1/how-to-upgrade-from-classic.html" target="_blank">upgrade to MultiBit HD</a>.</p>

<p>During the early part of the stress test we found the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (1,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (3,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>average time for transaction to be mined (10,000 satoshi fee):</li>
  <li>all transactions OK after Repair Wallet:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Overall we found that </p>

<ul>
  <li>MultiBit HD did better than Classic ?</li>
  <li>a replace by fee mechanism is required ?</li>
  <li>network load detection would be an improvement ?</li>
</ul>
