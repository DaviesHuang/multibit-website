<h3>Bitcoin network stress test</h3>

<p>On 20 June 2015 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3agk61/ultimate_bitcoin_stress_test_monday_june_22nd/" target="_blank">CoinWallet.eu announced</a>
  that they would perform a Bitcoin network stress test starting Monday 22 June 2015 and extending over 100 blocks. The stated intention was to discover
  whether the block size limit of 1MB would, when transaction volume exceeded its capacity, allow for quick recovery of the network to normal service.</p>

<p>During the stress test a range of fees, some exceeding 1,000 satoshi per KB of transaction, was allocated to each transaction. In simple terms, any Bitcoin wallet providing a fee
  less than or equal to this value would produce transactions that would be in competition with the stress test transactions and therefore potentially subject to a delay.</p>

<p>The fee associated with a transaction is largely dependent on the size in bytes of the transaction. Miners will generally
  pick transactions with higher fees per KB from the backlog and bring them to the front of the queue.</p>

<p>A more complex view would include the age of the coins and the fee rate per KB applied. Bitcoin rules prioritise older coins over newer ones and miners are believed to
  prioritise transactions with higher fees per KB of transaction.</p>

<p>We monitored the behaviour of both MultiBit HD (version 0.1.0) and Classic (version 0.5.18) during the stress test and the results are given
  below.</p>

<h4>MultiBit HD</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD uses a default base fee of 3,000 satoshis per KB which can be adjusted up or down through a range of 1,000 to 10,000 using
  the Preferences | Fees panel. Our research during development of MultiBit HD indicated that 3,000 satoshis per KB would usually place
  the transaction into the next block or two as of Summer 2015.</p>

<p>During the early part of the stress test we found the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>average number of blocks for transaction to be mined (1,000 satoshi per KB fee):</li>
  <li>average number of blocks for transaction to be mined (3,000 satoshi per KB fee):</li>
  <li>average number of blocks for transaction to be mined (10,000 satoshi per KB fee):</li>
</ul>

<h4>MultiBit Classic</h4>

<p>MultiBit Classic uses a fixed base fee of 1,000 satoshi per KB. It cannot be varied so users are not able to respond to an emerging
   market in fees.
<p>During the early part of the stress test we found the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>average number of blocks  for transaction to be mined (1,000 satoshi per KB fee):</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Because of the greater flexibility of fee settings in MultiBit HD we strongly urge users of MultiBit Classic to <a href="/help/hd0.1/how-to-upgrade-from-classic.html" target="_blank">upgrade to MultiBit HD</a>.</p>
