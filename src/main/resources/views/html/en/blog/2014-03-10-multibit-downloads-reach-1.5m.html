<h1>MultiBit downloads reach 1.5 million</h1>

<p>We were asked recently how many downloads there had been of MultiBit since its inception back in April 2011. To answer this Jim went off into the website download
  stats archive (and various Tweets of important milestones) and discovered that MultiBit has been downloaded over 1.5 million times.</p>

<p><img src="/images/en/blog/multibit-downloads-feb-2014.png" title="MultiBit downloads to Feb 2014" width="934" height="489"></p>

<p>In the very early days MultiBit was only used by the Bitcoinj mailing list. We don't have records from then so Jim put the downloads
  to be 'tiny'. They were probably less than a 100 a month. We also uncovered the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bitcoinj/multibit%7Csort:date/bitcoinj/Dq1N3oMFl8c/ob8ZYb5ROBYJ" target="_blank">first reference to MultiBit</a> from that archive.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin booms of April 2013 and November 2013 show up quite clearly. The big bump in late 2013 was caused by MultiBit becoming the recommended desktop client on
  <a href="" target="_blank">bitcoin.org</a>.</p>

<p>Currently the MultiBit development team are working hard on the next version of MultiBit (called MultiBit HD) which is targeted for mainstream Bitcoin users across
  the world. It will be fascinating to see what this chart looks like in 12 months time.</p>

<p>As Bitcoiners we should all remember that the effort that we are putting in does make a difference. Some of us are developers, others designers, accountants, lawyers,
  journalists, merchants and so on.</p>

<p>Working together we are changing the world.</p>
