<h1>MultiBit downloads reach 1.5 million</h1>

<p>With all the recent depressing news in the Bitcoin community we thought it would be a pleasant change to hear some good news. Last night Jim went over the download
  figures from our web stats archive and discovered that since its inception back in April 2011 MultiBit has been downloaded over 1.5 million times.</p>

<p>This is a cumulative figure so it includes people who have gone through upgrades but we continue to see fresh interest in Bitcoin from people all over the world in
  great numbers (many thousands per day).</p>

<p>As Bitcoiners we should all take heart that the effort that we are putting in does make a difference. Some of us are developers, others designers, accountants, lawyers,
  journalists, merchants and so on.</p>

<p>Working together we are changing the world.</p>
