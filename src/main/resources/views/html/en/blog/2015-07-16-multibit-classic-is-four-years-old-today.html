<h3>MultiBit Classic is four years old today</h3>

<p>On 16 July 2011 Jim pushed <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit/commit/75fb14dcaf4c1dc96732cd876d7aadc7736222ee" target="_blank">the first commit</a>
  of the MultiBit source code to GitHub. This marked the beginning of a long journey into the Bitcoin ecosystem which we thought we'd share with you today.</p>

<p>Some say that Internet years are like dog years. If that's true then Bitcoin years are at least double again. That makes MultiBit Class something like
  the equivalent of 56 years old in Bitcoin terms. It certainly feels that way.</p>

<h4>How did it all begin ?</h4>

<p>On the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoinj/Dq1N3oMFl8c/esRyfmha1cUJ" target="_blank">Bitcoinj mailing list</a>. Jim provided a link to a
Google Doc containing an initial proposal for a user interface to the growing Bitcoinj library. At first the idea was to simply add it directly into Bitcoinj
but this was quickly rejected by Mike Hearn who suggested that it be turned into a standalone consumer of Bitcoinj instead.</p>

<p>Shortly after that Jim and I collaborated on the user interface document and
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoinj/Dq1N3oMFl8c/PKNwx2L7XiEJ" target="_blank">MultiBit was born</a>.</p>

<h4>Where do we go now ?</h4>

<p>Classic will continue on in maintenance mode where we will issue occasional updates to ensure compatibility with modern operating
  systems and apply critical security fixes. So while we don't think we'll ever truly retire Classic it will no longer be the popular
  choice it once was and will be largely confined to more technical users of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has changed a lot in the past 4 years and we consider <a href="https://multibit.org">MultiBit HD</a> to be the better choice for
  our users now. Much of the tried and tested Classic code lives on in HD under the covers and when coupled with the extensive improvements
  and new features of HD it is a worthy upgrade.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see where the next 4 years takes us.</p>
