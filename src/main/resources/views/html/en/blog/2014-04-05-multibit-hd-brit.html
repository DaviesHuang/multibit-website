<h1>Introducing BRIT</h1>

<p>What's the best way to provide Bitcoin users with high quality wallet software ? How do the devs get paid ?</p>
<p>This article describes how we plan to do this for MultiBit HD.  We call it the Burton-Rowe Income Technique (BRIT).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With MultiBit HD we're introducing a client fee of 1,000 satoshis per spend. (For comparison: the current minimum miner's fee is 10,000 satoshis).
    This fee will go towards further development of MultiBit HD and will also be used to support upstream projects that
  MultiBit HD relies upon (such as Bitcoinj, XChange and so on). By charging a client fee we can avoid intrusive or privacy-breaking alternatives.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>MultiBit has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011. In that time it has seen continuous development and improvement.
    Recently <a href="/blog/2014/03/10/multibit-downloads-reach-1.5m.html">we celebrated 1.5million downloads.</a></p>
  <p>Supporting a metropolis of users and writing new features is now a full time job for a team.</p>

<p>Since October 2013 we've been working on the next version of MultiBit (MultiBit HD) which has a much better interface and a deterministic wallet.</p>

<p>Like everyone, we have bills to pay so we need to monetise MultiBit HD. Here are some of our key principles for creating MultiBit HD</p>
<ul>
  <li>Must be open source under MIT license:</li>
  <li>No gathering or selling information to third parties</li>
  <li>No in-app advertising</li>
  <li>Zero upfront cost</li>
  <li>Must be decentralised apart from an anonymous initial contact</li>
  <li>Fees must be extremely low</li>
  <li>Must allow income to be allocated to other parties efficiently</li>
  <li>All communications must rely on encrypted messages to prevent snooping, MITM and replay attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The result was a client fee of 1,000 satoshis per transaction. At $400 per bitcoin this is 0.4 cents for each transaction sent. A cup of coffee in Starbucks would pay
    for over 500 sends. There is no charge for receiving bitcoin. As this is below the Bitcoin dust limit of 5432 satoshis we bundle up these small amounts
    - you pay for them once every twenty or thirty sends from your wallet.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>BRIT contains some interesting technical details which will be of interest to developers of open source software. All the payment code, both client
    and server side will be released under the MIT licence for other teams to use freely.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To pay for future MultiBit development, we will be introducing a fee of 1,000 satoshi per spend in MultiBit HD.</p>
