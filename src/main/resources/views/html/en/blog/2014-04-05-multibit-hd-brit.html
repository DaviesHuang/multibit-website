<h1>Introducing BRIT</h1>

<p>What happens when an open source project starts to scale? Costs go up. This article describes how we decided to use Bitcoin
  to address this problem in what we consider to be the fairest way possible. We call it the Burton-Rowe Income Technique, or BRIT.</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>
<p>With MultiBit HD we're introducing a "client fee" of 1,000 satoshis per spend. The current miner's fee is 10,000 satoshis per 1Kb
  of transaction storage size. This fee will go towards further development of MultiBit HD and will also be used to support upstream projects that
  MultiBit HD relies upon (such as Bitcoinj, XChange and so on). By charging a client fee we can avoid intrusive or privacy-breaking alternatives.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>MultiBit has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011. In that time it has seen continuous development and improvement so that it is now considered
  one of the top Bitcoin wallets. Recently <a href="/blog/2014/03/10/multibit-downloads-reach-1.5m.html">we celebrated 1.5million downloads</a>
  and supporting that size of user base requires either very high reliability or a full time support team. We went for the high reliability approach.</p>

<p>Looking back to October 2013 we made the difficult decision to begin a rewrite of MultiBit Classic and MultiBit HD was born.
  We chose this path because it was clear that in order for Bitcoin to grow it was imperative that wallet handling had to be made
  much simpler for non-technical users. This meant ditching random private keys and moving to hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets based on
  the BIP32 and BIP39 standards.</p>

<p>We took a lot of the battle-hardened code from MultiBit Classic and improved it. We completely redesigned the user interface so that it would be
  easy for anyone to use. We laid the groundwork for supporting the Payment Protocol, external hardware wallets (Trezor etc), multi-signature and more. All
  this development has taken months of full time work, often 7 days a week, and we're only now approaching a first release in May.</p>

<p>Then we faced a hard fact: how do we get paid for all this effort ? We're a wallet not an exchange.</p>

<p>So we made a list laying out our constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>open source under MIT license</li>
  <li>no gathering or selling information to third parties</li>
  <li>no in-app advertising</li>
  <li>no upfront cost</li>
  <li>must be pure Bitcoin</li>
  <li>must survive an upgrade or wallet restore</li>
  <li>must be decentralised apart from an anonymous initial contact</li>
  <li>must be extremely low in consideration of people in third world countries</li>
  <li>must allow income to be allocated to other parties efficiently and anonymously</li>
  <li>must rely on encrypted messages to prevent snooping, MITM and replay attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The result was a client fee of 1,000 satoshis per transaction. This compares favourably with the current miner's fee of 10,000 satoshis
  per 1Kb (so transactions with a large number of inputs cost more). This would be charged on each spend but because the fee is well
  below the Bitcoin dust limit of 5432 satoshis, the actual spend won't take place until later. When a sufficient number of client fees
  have been accumulated the balance is paid off to a Bitcoin address that was obtained during set up.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>BRIT contains some interesting technical details which may be of interest to developers of open source software. For a complete treatment please
refer to the MultiBit HD code repository but what follows </p>

  TODO Finish off the techincal details...

There are three actors in the BRIT protocol:

The entity who will redeem the fee payments, called the Redeemer.
The entity who pays the fees, called the Payer.
A service that matches up the Redeemer with the Payer, called the Matcher.
