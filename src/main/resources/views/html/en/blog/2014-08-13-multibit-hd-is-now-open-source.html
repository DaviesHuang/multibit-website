<h3>MultiBit HD is now open source</h3>

<p>It has been a while since our last blog post so we thought we'd give you an update on our progress.</p>

<p>As usual in the Bitcoin world the pace has been hectic. Over the summer, we have been focused on improvements to the MultiBit HD codebase. We now have a lot more automated testing and have incorporated the tremendous feedback from our Private Beta testers on the overall application's usability. Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>We are also pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd" target="_blank">the MultiBit HD GitHub repository is now open source</a>.</p>

<p>Previously we have kept the code somewhat under wraps to reduce the number of casual developers using the code. This has enabled us to experiment with different user interface designs and implementations of features without the worry that making sweeping changes to the codebase would cause people to have problems.</p>

<h4>Private Beta 3 is available for download</h4>

<p>Now that the MultBit HD code is maturing we would like to welcome more people on to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/multibit-hd-private-beta" target="_blank">beta
  testing programme</a>. This gives early access to the MultiBit HD beta code and the opportunity to see the new website and installers in action.</p>

<p>On the subject of installers, we have finally ditched the Oracle Java installer and moved to a fully self-contained installation process dedicated to Windows, OS X and Linux. This facility has been provided by the <a href="http://www.jwrapper.com/" target="_blank">JWrapper team</a> who have proved excellent in this regard. We still have some finishing off of the installers to do which we will do in Private Beta 4.</p>
