<h1>MultiBit HD is now open source</h1>

<p>It's been a while since our last blog post so we thought we'd bring you up to speed with what we've been doing.</p>

<p>As usual in the Bitcoin world the pace has been hectic and we've found ourselves maxed out with delivering MultiBit HD to
  a standard that exceeds the existing MultiBit Classic. This has meant a lot of automated testing and the tremendous help
  from our Private Beta testers (thanks everyone!) who have given us valuable feedback on the overall application.</p>

<p>Probably the most important step forward we've made recently is to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd" target="_blank">open source the MultiBit HD GitHub
  repository</a>.</p>

<p>Up until yesterday we've had to keep the code somewhat under wraps to reduce the number of casual developers using the
  code. This has given us the breathing space to experiment with different user interface designs and implementations of features
  without the worry that making sweeping changes to the codebase would cause people to lose their bitcoins.</p>

<h3>Private Beta 3 is available for download</h3>

<p>Now that the code is starting to mature we'd like to welcome more people on to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/multibit-hd-private-beta" target="_blank">beta
  testing programme</a> which gives early access to the MultiBit HD beta code and a chance to see the new website and installers in action.</p>

<p>On the subject of installers, we've finally been able to ditch the horrible Oracle Java installers and move to a fully self-contained
  installation process dedicated to Windows, OS X and Linux. This facility has been provided by the <a href="http://www.jwrapper.com/" target="_blank">JWrapper team</a>
  who have proved excellent in this regard.</p>

<h3>Localisation</h3>

<p>If you are a localiser and want to translate MultiBit HD into your language we have uploaded the language packs to CrowdIn. We lifted as many
  existing translations as we could directly from MultiBit Classic, but there are quite a few new ones that need attention. We have significantly
  improved the language support so that regional dialects (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese) are fully supported.</p>

<p>As before anyone who contributes translation effort will, at their discretion, get their name mentioned in the contributors section which can be useful when
  building an online portfolio of work done.</p>

<p>The way we see it the more languages that are available then the more countries Bitcoin is able to reach natively which can only be a good thing
  for global adoption.</p>
