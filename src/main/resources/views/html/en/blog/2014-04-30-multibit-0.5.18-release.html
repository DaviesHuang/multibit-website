<h1>MultiBit 0.5.18 release - private key safety improvements</h1>

<p>In the MultiBit 0.5.18 release there are two changes we have made to improve the safety of your private keys. These are described below:</p>

<h2>Private key imports of blockchain.info wallet exports are no longer supported</h2>
<p>Recently a user found that one of their private keys was incorrect and Mike Hearn kindly performed forensics on the issue. The user had performed an import of a blockchain.info encrypted wallet backup into MultiBit. Unfortunately the original source file he used to do this is no longer available for study. Blockchain.info developers were asked if anything has changed in their export formats recently but nothing has. The root cause of the error was thus not precisely established.</p>
<p>To avoid this happening to any user in the future we have removed the ability to import blockchain.info 'json' and 'json.aes' wallet backups into MultiBit. In the past, this functionality helped the overall resilience of the Bitcoin ecosystem - if blockchain.info was DDOSed users could migrate their private keys into MultiBit. This is less critical now as they are alternate ways to recover your blockchain.info private keys. For instance blockchain.info now provides a static page <a href="https://blockchain.info/DecryptWallet.html">DecryptWallet</a> to decrypt their wallet backups.</p><By removing this outdated option from MultiBit we close down this error path and improve reliability.</p>

<h2>MultiBit utility to check your wallet's private keys is now available</h2>
<p>So far we have seen only a single case of this particular error occurring. It is entirely natural for MultiBit users who have also imported private keys from blockchain.info to want to check that their wallet is OK. To help users to do this we have added a utility "Tools | Check Private Keys" into MultiBit version 0.5.18 .</p>
<p>This utility crosschecks the wallet's private keys with the wallet's receiving addresses by recalculating everything from scratch. There is help on this utility <a href="/en/help/v0.5/help_checkPrivateKeys.html">here</a>.</p>
