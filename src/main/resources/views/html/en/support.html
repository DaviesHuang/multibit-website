<h1>The MultiBit Team</h1>
<p>The following people are involved in the creation of MultiBit</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jim Burton (Lead developer)</li>

  <li><a href="http://obscuredclarity.blogspot.co.uk/">Tim Molter (Contributor)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Fast fixes</h1>
<p>Sometimes a transaction seems to get "stuck" leading to concern that it hasn't been sent or received. This is almost
  always fixed by using the "Reset Blockchain" option from the Tools menu.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="help.html">release documentation</a> for your version.</p>

<h1>Reporting a bug</h1>
<p>If you discover a bug in MultiBit we welcome feedback - it makes MultiBit better for everyone. We are introducing
  an automatic error reporting system that can be used to send us information about what went wrong (subject to your
  consent and keeping your privacy very much in mind). We expect this to be available in v0.5.x</p>
<p>Until then, the manual bug reporting procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the following text:
<pre>
  Bug report
  Operating System:
  MultiBit Version:
  Steps to replicate the problem:
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit/issues">MultiBit Issue reporting center</a> and perform
    a quick search in the "Issues & Milestones" box to check that no-one else has reported the same issue as you.
  </li>
  <li>Assuming yours is unique (no point flooding us with duplicates) then click on "New Issue".</li>
  <li>Paste the template text and fill it in for your system. The more detail you can give the quicker we can address the problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the number of downloads of MultiBit now gets we cannot answer every support query personally. We do see these issues
  and make acknowledging them a priority.</p>

<h2>Looking for a workaround</h2>
<p>The MultiBit community is resourceful and often comes up with workarounds to issues while we work on eradicating them.
  You may find that a bit of searching in some dedicated websites will reveal a solution to get you on the road again
  quickly. A quick search on
  <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/search?q=multibit">Bitcoin StackExchange</a> can be fruitful as can
