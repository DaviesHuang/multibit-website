<#-- jQuery and Bootstrap are served from CDNs to reduce latency
     and bandwidth due to better caching.

     The security and resiliency argument is not so strong for
     these libraries since browsers are likely to already have
     them and it is extremely unlikely that the CDN owners will
     arbitrarily remove support.

     The content will be served over HTTPS so it does not affect
     the security realm.
