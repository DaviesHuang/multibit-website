      <h3 class="image">MultiBit Privacy Policy</h3>
<br>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Multibit.org is a privately run site hosting the MultiBit software. Multibit.org runs on a dedicated server located in a data centre in Strasbourg, France. This machine is owned and managed by <a href="http://www.server4you.com">www.server4you.com</a>. In this Privacy Policy, “We” or "us" means any user with SSH access to this server. As of Feb 2013, the only user with SSH access to this server is Jim Burton. It is a condition of having SSH access to this machine that you agree to comply with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>By visiting our website and downloading MultiBit, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in this privacy policy.</p>


<h3>Your data</h3>
<p>We take steps where possible to limit the personal data we collect. The following are the ways in which we may collect personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visiting our website. We keep records of the activity that takes place on our website, including a record of Internet Protocol Addresses (IP addresses) used by website visitors. We use this information to analyse market trends, gather broad demographic information, and to prevent abuse of our services.</p></li>
<li><p>Downloading our software. When you download MultiBit, we record the IP address you used to download it.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating with us. When you communicate with us, you may provide us with personal data about yourself. Your communication with us may be retained by us.</p></li>
<li><p>Accessing MultiBit help. The MultiBit help files are hosted on the multibit.org server. When you access MultiBit help, we record your IP address.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>How long do we retain your data?</h3>
<p>The following outlines how our data retention policy affects any data we store about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We delete your access logs after approximately 5 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Any email communication you make with us we may retain indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Summary statistics (which will not show individual user data) we may retain indefinitely.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h3>Disclosure of user data</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances, we do not and will never disclose user data to anyone other than that user. We will always attempt to authenticate any requests that require the disclosure of user data to ensure they come from the user. If we are unable to successfully authenticate a request, we do not disclose any user data.</p>

<p>We will only disclose user data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If we receive an order enforceable under the laws of France, compelling us to disclose user data for a specific user. Because such orders generally state that we are not permitted to disclose the existence of the order to a user, we will not disclose to any user the existence, or nonexistence, of any order we may have received.</p></li> 
</ul>

<p>We do not use cookies to manage your sessions.</p>

<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the third-party services we use do not share information with other third parties. You should, however, verify this yourself by reviewing each site’s Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>We do not use any third-party advertising providers on our website.</p>

<h3>Use of Twitter</h3>
<p>We use a Twitter signup on our website and hence access of the multibit.org index.html page will appear in the twitter.com IP logs.</p>

<h3>Constant improvement</h3>
<p>This privacy policy is under constant review and may be modified and updated in the future.</p>

<h3>Contact us</h3>
<p>We value your opinions and appreciate your comments. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us as described at: <a href="team.html">team.html</a></p>
